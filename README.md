# Dungeon
Dungeon Engine
The non-commercial game engine that I build for learning purposes. I am currently working on the renderer (using OpenGL). For future work planning to add Logging system, Entity-Component System, etc.

# Getting Started
The project contains Visual Studio Solution file(.sln) which means you can clone and open with. So it is only available on Windows atm.

```
git clone https://github.com/62bit/Dungeon.git
```
